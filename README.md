# Oh, Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelsey Sikes. Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in the Human-Aware Planning Lab (HAPI) at Colorado State University, working under Dr. Sarath Sreedharan. 

Iâ€™m really interested in the human mind and intelligence, especially as it relates to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Currently, I am conducting research related to automated planning and value alignment using primarily Python and PDDL. 

During my graduate studies, Iâ€™ve also contributed to research projects related to:
* :brain: Using fMRI data to enhance artificial neural network robustness 
* :pencil2: Improving student collaborative problem-solving skills using natural language processing 

Previously, I worked as a web developer at Anheuser-Busch, designing and developing websites.
