# Oh, Hello 👋

My name is Kelsey Sikes. I’m a Ph.D. student in the Human-Aware Planning & Interaction Lab (HAPI) at Colorado State University, working under Dr. Sarath Sreedharan. 

I’m really interested in the human mind and intelligence, especially as it relates to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Currently, I am conducting research related to automated planning and value alignment. 

During my graduate studies, I’ve also contributed to research projects related to:
* :brain: Using fMRI data to enhance artificial neural network robustness 
* :pencil2: Tracking gesture, gaze, joint attention, etc. to improve student collaborative learning 
* 🐝: Designing a POMDP-based intelligent tutoring system to teach bee classification 
* 🤖: Better aligning human-robot final goal states using environment design and the novel GSD metric 
* 📋: Improving the SQL generation capabilities of LLM’s using an agentic approach

Previously, I worked as a web developer at Anheuser-Busch (designing and developing websites), and interned at IBM Research and the Naval Research Lab.
