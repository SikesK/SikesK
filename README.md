# Oh, Hello 👋

My name is Kelsey Sikes. I’m a Ph.D. student in the Human-Aware Planning & Interaction Lab (HAPI) at Colorado State University, working under Dr. Sarath Sreedharan. 

I’m really interested in the human mind and intelligence, especially as it relates to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Currently, I am conducting research related to automated planning and value alignment. 

During my graduate studies, I’ve contributed to research projects related to:
* :brain: Using fMRI data to enhance artificial neural network robustness 
* :pencil2: Exploring the nuances of human interactions in collaborative learning tasks via gesture, gaze, joint attention, etc.
* 🐝: Designing a POMDP-based intelligent tutoring system to help citizen scientists classify bee species 
* 🤖: Better aligning the final goal state a robot achieves with what a human expects using environmnet design and the novel Goal State Divergence metric 
* 📋: Improving the SQL generation capabilities of LLM’s using an agentic approach

Previously, I worked as a web developer at Anheuser-Busch, designing and developing websites.
